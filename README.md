# London-Sewer-Navigation-Game
Please email me for code on this project
The London Sewer System is well known for its complex web of underground tunnels. In this project you will model and navigate this sewer network, represented as a graph. Our protagonist, McDiver, is tasked with finding a ring with special powers that has been hidden in the sewer. His job is to navigate the maze to find the ring. Fortunately, this does not have to be a completely blind search—McDiver has a detector that can measure the distance to the ring, so he can tell when he is getting closer.

When McDiver finds the ring, it turns out that it is booby-trapped. McDiver is dropped into a lower level of tunnels where there is additional treasure sprinkled all through the maze. Fortunately, McDiver immediately finds the map to this lower level and wants to collect some treasure on the way out. But toxic fumes in the sewer are starting to take a toll. So the goal is to head to the exit in the prescribed number of steps while still picking up as much treasure as possible along the way—quickly enough to avoid falling victim to those noxious fumes!
